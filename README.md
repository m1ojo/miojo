# MIOJO

**MIOJO** **I**s an **O**nline **J**udge **O**rchestrator. In other words, it's a platform where you can run contests using competitive programming problems from multiple Online Judges (OJ) like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), [URI](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) and [UVA](https://uva.onlinejudge.org).

One of the main reasons why we opted to develop this project and make it [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), is that we are interested on the _extensibility_ of OJ bots, so if for any reason your preferred OJ isn't available, it should be easy to add it yourself or quick to ask for someone to do that for you ([via an issue](https://github.com/m1ojo/miojo/issues)).

## Current State

We are at the very beginning of the project, so there isn't much implemented yet, but feel free to check the [issues](https://github.com/m1ojo/miojo/issues) and the [community channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/Bw6WeZc).

## About

MIOJO started as a homework assignment for Parallel and Distributed Systems course on Universidade do Estado do Amazonas. You can check the final presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jl-1IGpdKm-yV8_41RVrdHwNT4MX7BNrI6Xl1aTHJtM/edit?usp=sharing) (in portuguese), which gives a more detailed explanation about this project.
